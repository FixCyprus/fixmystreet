# How FixMyStreet uses MapIt

<p class="lead">When you add a <a href="/glossary/#body" class="glossary">body</a> toFixMyStreet,
you specify which <a href="/glossary/#area" class="glossary">areas</a> it
covers. The areas are typically defined by administrative boundaries: these
are <em>not</em> part of FixMyStreet, but are made available through our
service called <a href="/glossary/#mapit" class="glossary">MapIt</a>. </p>

Note that MapIt tells FixMyStreet what administrative boundaries a point lies
within: it does not actually draw the maps (by default, FixMyStreet uses
OpenStreetMap for that).

## How this works

When someone places a pin on the FixMyStreet <a href="/glossary/#map" class="glossary">map</a> to report a problem,
FixMyStreet sends the <a href="/glossary/#latlong" class="glossary">lat-long</a> coordinates of that position to MapIt. MapIt
responds with a list of the areas that the pin lies within. FixMyStreet then
looks in its own database to find all the bodies that cover that area, and the
<a href="/glossary/#contact" class="glossary">contacts</a> (which are usually email addresses) that you have added for each of
those bodies. Because each contact is associated with a <a href="/glossary/#category" class="glossary">category</a> of problem
(for example, "Potholes" or "Graffiti"), FixMyStreet can build a list of all
the problem categories that *can* be reported at this location. In fact, this
list appears as the drop-down menu ("Pick a category") on the report-a-problem
page.

This means that your FixMyStreet installation must be able to connect to a
MapIt service which knows about the administrative areas in your part of the
world.

# Three ways FixMyStreet can use MapIt

There are three ways to use MapIt with your FixMyStreet installation.

1. just assume everywhere is within one boundless area
2. use mySociety's MapIt servers (OpenStreetMap data)
3. use your own MapIt server with custom data


## 1. FakeMapIt: Everything is in One Area

The simplest setup is to assume *everywhere* is covered by a single area
(called `Everywhere`). This is so simple that actually the default setup for
FixMyStreet behaves in this way. It connects to its own internal "FakeMapIt",
which responds with the same area every time.

This is all you need if you just want to get your installation up and running,
or don't need to send reports to different bodies simply because they are in
different places.

To use this approach, in the `conf/general.yml` file, set `MAPIT_URL` to be blank
(because you're not really connecting to a real MapIt service at all), and set
`MAPIT_TYPES` to `[ 'ZZZ' ]`, which is a list containing the single type that
FakeMapIt always returns for everywhere.


## 2. Use mapit.mysociety.org

We run two public MapIt services:
[mapit.mysociety.org](http://mapit.mysociety.org) covers the UK (because
that's where we're based, and it serves our own [UK
FixMySteet](www.fixmystreet.com) site), and
[global.mapit.mysociety.org](http://global.mapit.mysociety.org), which covers
the whole world. The data we use for global MapIt is from
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org), so if someone has put
administrative boundary data for your country into OSM, before too long global
MapIt will have it too.

Please get in touch with us if you are expecting to generate a lot of requests
or **if you are using it commercially**. We rate-limit calls to MapIt, so if
your site gets really busy, you should set up your own instance (we can help
you, and the [code is on github](http://github.com/mysociety/mapit)). But when
you're setting your site up to begin with, you can get it running using one of
these two servers.

To use the mySociety MapIt instances, set `MAPIT_URL` either to
`http://mapit.mysociety.org/` (UK) or `http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/`.
You **must** also list the `MAPIT_TYPES` you are interested in: different
types of area have a different code. For example, for UK FixMyStreet, we use:

    [ 'DIS', 'LBO', 'MTD', 'UTA', 'CTY', 'COI', 'LGD' ]

which covers all the UK council types (for example, `DIS` is district council,
`CTY` is county council). If you're using global mapit, the area types look
something like `[ 'O05', 'O06' ]`. (Note those contain capital letter O
followed by digits). To determine what types you need, look for the codes
marked "Administrative Boundary Levels" that MapIt returns -- for example,
here's [global MapIt's data for
Zurich](http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/8.55,47.366667.html).

### Whitelisting specific areas

It's quite common for people setting up localised FixMyStreet to know exactly
which areas they are interested in. If this applies to you, you can specify a
`MAPIT_ID_WHITELIST` which explicitly lists *only* those area IDs (returned by
global MapIt) that your installation will use. For example,

    MAPIT_ID_WHITELIST: [ 240838, 246176, 246733 ]

FixMyStreet will work fine if you leave the whitelist blank, which is the
default. But if your FixMyStreet is only using a few areas, it's more
efficient to specify them in this way.

### Finding the right global MapIt values: example

Here's an example of the steps to follow to find the data you need to use
global MapIt. This example uses Zurich as an example city.

1. Go to [OpenStreetMap's geocoder](http://nominamtim.openstreetmap.org) and
   enter the name of the city, e.g., "Zurich, Switzerland".

2. Check that's found the right place (and, if you want, check the map is how
   you expected). Click on the **details** link just below the name of the top
   hit. The details page lists lots of data, including the centre point
   (lat/long values that will look something like `-34.9059039,-56.1913569`).

3. Go to [global MapIt](http://global.mapit.mysociety.org) and paste those
   lat/long values into the text input.

4. MapIt will show you all the [admin
boundaries](http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/8.55,47.366667.html)
   that contain that point. You're interested in the ones that relate to
   bodies that serve those areas. For example, if a district council fixes the
   potholes in that district. Specifically, you need the **Administrative
   Boundary Levels** (which will look like `O04` or `O05`), which are the
   values for your `MAPIT_TYPES`. Remember this data is boundary data from
   OpenStreetMap -- if the boundaries you need are not shown, you may have to
   set up your own (described below). You can also click on any of the
   boundaries listed on MapIt to see the areas they actually cover on the map.

5. The individual *area_id*s are also useful, because you put them into the
   `MAPIT_ID_WHITELIST`.

### Missing OSM boundary data?

If you want to use global MapIt, but the OSM data does not cover your country,
there are two things you can do. Ideally, find the boundary data you need
(maybe the government publishes it?) and add it to OpenStreetMap, so that
MapIt global can use it. If you're going to do that, **the data must be open
data** and you should probably ask about it on the [OSM import
list](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/imports) first. Of course, if
you do this, it means anyone else in the world can use it too, if they want.

Alternatively, if you can't get accurate boundary data, you can set up your
own MapIt instance that just covers what you need in order to get your
FixMyStreet working, which is described below.


## 3. Set up your own MapIt

If neither 1. or 2. work for you, you can
[set up your own installation of MapIt](http://code.mapit.mysociety.org/install/),
and add your own areas. The
[code is on github](http://github.com/mysociety/mapit) and is a simple Django
project. Ideally, if you have KML or Shapefile data for the admin boundaries you need,
or if you have GIS software that can produce these formats, you can
[import KML or Shapefiles into MapIt](http://code.mapit.mysociety.org/import/boundaries/).
Alternatively, you can add new areas just using MapIt: the admin lets you draw
your boundary over a map in the web browser and save it. (If you require accurate boundary
data, we recommend you use GIS software to do this, simply because MapIt's drawing tool
is rather basic).

When you add a new admin boundary to MapIt, you have to specify what kind of
area it is too, with a type: use a code that makes sense (in the UK we use
`DIS` for District councils, but you can use anything you want).

The advantage of this is you can just add the data you need (for example, if
you're getting FixMyStreet to work on a couple of islands, and you need them
to be different areas, the chances are you don't need super-accurate official
boundary data: just draw a close polygon around the coast). You only need to
be as accurate as your FixMyStreet requires.

If you want to run your own MapIt, in the `conf/general.yml` file you must set
the `MAPIT_URL` to the URL of your custom installation, and list the
`MAPIT_TYPES` that match the types you entered when you added your own areas,
for example, `[ 'ABC', 'XYZ ]`.

## Some notes

If you do want to use our UK or global MapIt services, but need it to not be
rate-limited, or **if you will be using it commercially**, let us know. We can
either help you set up your own (with the OSM data in it), or perhaps arrange
to run one for you.

Note that **more than one body can cover the same area** (actually it's quite
common) -- for example two national bodies (the Highways Department and the
Water Department) would both have the same (national) boundary data.

One useful consequence of the way you set up the areas (in MapIt) and bodies
(in FixMyStreet) is that **nobody can report a problem at a location that is
not in an area covered by a body**. This means, if someone tries to place a
pin in an area covered not by your FixMyStreet (for example, in the middle of
the sea), the application will be able to tell the user that that location is
not supported. Of course, this is the drawback of using FakeMapIt: every
location is always _within_ boundary of FakeMapIt's default area (which is
`Everywhere`).
